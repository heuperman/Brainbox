# Brainbox
*A place to store your knowledge. Give your poor brain a rest, let Brainbox do the heavy lifting.*

Brainbox is a simple Progressive Web App for taking notes, allowing users to easily store acquired knowledge on their phone.

## Try it out
Visit [Brainbox](https://heuperman.github.io/Brainbox/) and start taking notes. 

If you are visiting the site on a mobile phone you will be prompted to add the app to your home screen,
so you can access it as easily as you would a native app.  

Brainbox is intended for mobile use and as such may look somewhat odd on desktop.  

Be aware that your notes are saved in local storage and could be lost if you clear your browsing data.  

## Making changes
1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/heuperman/Brainbox.git`  
2. Edit away!  
Simply open index.html in your browser and refresh the page to see your changes.

## Project goals
My goals for this project are to get a basic understanding of PWAs and service workers as well as making a no frills
app that would allow me to take notes on the go with minimal complexity.
